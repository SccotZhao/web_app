A database to store DukePerson
===================


In this project I constructed an enum to store the programming languages of each person in the database. I extends the class Person and abide by the two protocols CustomStringConvertible and BlueDevil.

For the DukePerson class I add some properties of various types. I use the description of the protocol to describe the DukePerson.

There are three functions: whoIs, allHobbies, getNameWithGender. These functions provide basic search in the database.


For the homework2, in addition to the required function, I added the following:

### 1. An imageView and a random number generator to generator a random number and then link this to the random imageView

### 2. add an update button

### 3. add two button yesbutton and nobutton. If the user wants to add, we will ask the user whether he/she needs to do that

### 4. add a clear button to clear the information in the textField
